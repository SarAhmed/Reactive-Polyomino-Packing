_Reactive Polymino Packing algorithm_ is developed to introduce interactivity within a packed layout of arbitrarily shaped objects, such as, dragging one of the objects from one place to another, rotating, shrinking or enlarging it.

## Motivation
In the last few decades, many heuristic algorithms, such as strip-packing, tiling, alternate-bisection and polyomino-packing algorithm have been developed to address the packing problem where objects are usually laid out individually and then packed together into a compact layout. Yet, these heuristics have been developed for generating static plots which makes it hard to accommodate interactive manipulations of the combined layout – e.g., drag one object across the packed layout to a new position, rotate, enlarge or shrink it. In the light of filling the aforementioned research gap, we propose a novel approach based on the Polyomino-Packing that detects overlapping and underlapping between the packed objects and uses these metrics to refine an interactively changed layout to satisfy the packing constraints.
